## Place pretrained models here. 

We provide three of the best performing pretrained models:

1. `Adam_50_2e-4.pth`: models weights training using the Adam optimizer for 50 epochs at a learning rate of 0.0002 
2. `AdamW_50_2e-4.pth`: models weights training using the AdamW optimizer for 50 epochs at a learning rate of 0.0002
3. `Adamdelta_50_2e-3.pth`: models weights training using the Adadelta optimizer for 50 epochs at a learning rate of 0.002

File naming convention: Optimizer_#epochs_LearnRate
